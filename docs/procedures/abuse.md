# Abuse

Someone should probably update this properly, but here's what I remember...

## mailing list members

* Redbrick Chair
* Redbrick Sec
* all rootholders

## Mails

Basically the idea was that admins would deal with stuff to do with the network - ports listening,
files hosted etc., and the committee would deal with anything else (on the committee list). This
was because at one point there was like 30 people on the abuse list (admins@ was bigger then), and
things just got a bit mad.
