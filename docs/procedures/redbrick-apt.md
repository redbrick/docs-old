# Redbrick Apt

## Parts of these docs our out of date including links

The aim of this is to make setting up machines and pushing out updates easier. May also facilitate
other people using our packages if anyone actually wanted to. It runs as the rbpkg user, from it's
home directory.

I followed [this tutorial](http://www.debian-administration.org/article/Setting_up_your_own_APT_repository_with_upload_support)
to set it up. Well, kinda. Ours doesn't do automated importing or anything like that. [This manual](http://alioth.debian.org/scm/viewvc.php/*checkout*/mirrorer/docs/manual.html?revision=HEAD&root=mirrorer)
is about the best thing I've found on reprepro.

## Adding Packages

The passphrase for the gpg key to sign the release is needed whenever it is updated. This is in
pwsafe.

### Easy Way

```bash
  su rbpkg
  add_package /path/to/package.deb
```

The add_package script is in `~rbpkg/bin`. The script will ensure that the right arguments are
passed to reprepro, and that the permissions are correct afterwards.

### Package Checks

The scripts to add packages will use lintian to check the packages. If an error is found then you'll
have to confirm that you want the import to continue. Some errors will be unavoidable, but, try keep
them to a minimum.

### Hard Way

``` bash
su rbpkg
cd ~/public_html/apt
reprepro --ask-passphrase -C main -Vb . includedeb stable /path/to/package.deb
```

This will break permissions on the files :(

```bash
  chmod 755 `find /webtree/r/rbpkg/apt/dists/ -type d`
  chmod 644 `find /webtree/r/rbpkg/apt/dists/ -type f`
  chmod 755 `find /webtree/r/rbpkg/apt/pool/ -type d`
  chmod 644 `find /webtree/r/rbpkg/apt/pool/ -type f`
```

The add_packages script should be used in preference of adding packages manually.

## Building Packages

[here](http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Debian-Binary-Package-Building-HOWTO/) was the simplest guide I
could find. Most were setup for building big things, which doesn't really apply to us. Most things
also focused on building source packages first, which doesn't really apply either.

### Dummy's Guide to Building New Packages

* `cp -ar` the template directory in `~rbpkg/packages`
* add in scripts, manpages etc. Remove the placeholder content
* edit `debian/DEBIAN/control` so that it matches the new package
* `set_changelog`
* `build`

### Dummy's Guide to Updating Packages

* make changes
* update `debian/DEBIAN/control`
* `set_changelog`
* `build`

### Notes

* Things which are compressed should generally use `gzip --best`. Not doing this makes lintian complain.

## Sources.list

``` text
  deb http://packages.redbrick.dcu.ie/ stable main
```

The keyring can be installed with the redbrick-keyring package, or downloaded from [packages.redbrick.dcu.ie](http://packages.redbrick.dcu.ie)

## Testing Packages

In some cases it might be appropriate to package unstable/testing builds for testing environments.
The repo contains two components - redbrick and redbrick-test. Packages add with the `add_testing`
script will go into redbrick-test. Users should consider redbrick-test to be
unstable-rawhide-development-testing-which-may-eat-your-babies.

``` text
  deb http://packages.redbrick.dcu.ie/ unstable main
```

## Packages

Note, the meta dependences included below are mostly provided as an example of what a package will
provide, and may not be a complete list of the dependencies of the current versions of these
packages. Use apt-cache to check the full list of current dependencies for these packages.

### Meta

* **redbrick-server** -  pulls in things that are needed on all servers, not just login servers:
    * logwatch-apt
    * logwatch-chkrootkit
    * redbrick-nagios-nrpe
    * nfs-kernel-server
    * openssh-server
    * syslog-ng
    * redbrick-root-env
    * fail2ban
    * exim4-daemon-light
    * openntpd|ntp
* **redbrick-login-server** - this pulls in almost everything in the redbrick repo to create a
  login.redbrick environment. Also depends on:
    * sl
    * vim
    * pwsafe
    * weechat-curses
    * irssi
    * etc.
* **redbrick-backup-server** - Depends on redbrick-server, ldap-utils, and all the backup system
  packages. Conflicts with mlocate, cause this seems to run for ages and use loads of disk space on
  these machines.

## Userland

* **[c-hey](/services/hey)**, for both i386 and amd64
* **[huh](/services/hey)**, for amd64 only. The i386 hey doesn't support huh. This package still
  requires that you manually configure syslog.ng as per the docs. It also doesn't set up it's
  group and stuff, this should be changed in the next version of this package. The huh.i386
  package is a dummy to satisfy the dependency of redbrick-login-server.
* **redbrick-news**: news, usenet, newsbeuter
* **[redbrick-noscripts](/procedures/rbscripts)**: nohelp, noforward, nopermwarn
* **redbrick-mail**: mdfrm, mdmake, vcard.filter, octet-filter. Creates `/usr/local/etc/mailcap`,
  and pulls in all the dependencies for converting attachments.
* **[redbrick-motd](/services/unifiedmotd)**: update_motd, init script to fix motd on boot, cron
  script to update nightly and `/etc/motd.*` files.
* **[redbrick-help](/procedures/rbscripts)**: the help script, and the message shown on login.
* **[rbquota](/procedures/rbscripts)**
* **[rbusers](/procedures/rbusers)**, for both i386 and amd64
* **[redbrick-local](/procedures/ldapchshchfn)**: Redbrick specific scripts and stuff which need to
  go in `/usr/local/bin` to be higher on the path than the system defaults. Note: this package
  should not "replace" any ubuntu packages. Contains: chsh & chfn for ldap, and the screen wrapper
  script.
* **redbrick-shells**: Creates symlinks for `/usr/local/shells`. Depends on redbrick-shell-env,
  redbrick-shell-disabled, ksh, tcsh & csh
* **redbrick-shell-disabled**: Contains the binaries for the expired & disabled shells. This is arch
  dependant, nothing else should be in here.
* **redbrick-shell-env**: shell/mutt/slrn/irssi config files. This package contains config files for
  various things, and as such "Replaces" the config files owned by the original package. This
  package should only contain config files and should be the only package that "replaces" another
  for this purpose. The only dependencies of this package should be shells it configures - bash, zsh
  and packages which `/etc/shell_cmd` requires to exist - rbquota and redbrick-help. It should
  "recommend" any other packages which it has config files for.
* **[peepd-irssi](/legacy/services/peepd)**: Irssi scripts to use with peepd.

## System

* **logwatch-apt**: Apt script for logwatch based on apticron
* **logwatch-chkrootkit**: Chkrootkit script for logwatch.
* **redbrick-logwatch**: Depends logwatch-apt, logwatch-chkrootkit. Moves the log mail time to
  12.30pm by default, and mails system-reports. Replaces `/etc/cron.daily/00logwatch`.
* **redbrick-root-env**: root shell environment.
* **redbrick-nagios-nrpe**: replaces `/etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg` with global redbrick version. Depends:
  nagios-nrpe-server, nagios-plugins.
* **redbrick-cron-scripts**: Standalone cron scripts. Currently the only script is 'dpkglist', which
  saves the output of `dpkg -l` to `/var/backups nightly`.
* **[peepd](/legacy/services/peepd)**: atlas' twitter irc gateway
* **mail2nntp** - this is needed on the mailhosts to post mailing lists to boards via aliases.
* **apt-wtfdidichange** - script to show changes to text files provided by packages.
* **munin-plugins-redbrick** - Extra plugins for munin. This package was called munin-plugins-extra,
  but there's a package in lenny/lucid with the same name. Has stuff for mysql, dovecot, slapd etc.

### Backup System

These packages are designed to keep the [backup systems](/legacy/procedures/dirvish) on [thunder](#)
and [severus](#) in sync, and also to allow backup servers to be quickly redeployed
when necessary.

* **redbrick-dirvish**: Contains all the configuration for the dirvish system. Also patches `/usr/sbin/dirvish`
  to stop it complaining about error 24.
* **redbrick-backup-dir**: Contains the directories that need to be created for the Redbrick backup
  system.
* **redbrick-mysqlslave**: Scripts for making backups of slave mysql servers with dirvish.
* **redbrick-docs2**: Scripts for mirroring the docs wiki using backups taken by dirvish.
* **logwatch-dirvish**: Logwatch script to report on backup activity, based on the report script in
  the development branch of dirvish.
* **logwatch-mysqlslave**: Logwatch script to report the status of mysql slaves.

### Backport Packages

See the list of packages [backported](/procedures/backport-packages) to hardy from other
debian/ubuntu releases.

## Man Pages

Everything packaged into `/usr/(s)bin` should have a corresponding manpage. Not everything has man
pages yet, but, I'm adding them as things are upgraded.

The name and directory will depend on the category..

1. Executable programs or shell commands
2. System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
3. Library calls (functions within program libraries)
4. Special files (usually found in /dev)
5. File formats and conventions eg `/etc/passwd`
6. Games
7. Miscellaneous (including macro  packages  and  conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
8. System administration commands (usually only for root)
9. Kernel routines [Non standard]

Generally, RedBrick man pages will be in category 1 or 8.

An example script in category 1 would be located in `usr/share/man/man1/example-script.1`

This is a sample man page you can edit.

Use `nroff -man` to test the formatting is ok. Manpages must be compressed with `gzip ---best`
