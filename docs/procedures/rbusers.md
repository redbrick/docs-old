# RBUsers

There are various versions of this floating around.

There's source for it in `/srv/admin/src`, but someone somewhere could possibly have a more recent
version

rbusers is available in both i386 and amd64 from [redbrick-apt](redbrick-apt)

Ideally someone should write a shiny python version of this
