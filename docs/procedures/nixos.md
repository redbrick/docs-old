### Who is nixos and what does he do
Nixos is a distribution of linux that is focused on having a config-first operating system to run services. The advantages of such an approach are the following:
 - Files dictate how an installation is set up, and as such, can be versoined and tracked in your favorite VCS.
 - New configs can be tested, and safely rolled back.
 - Can be used for both physical and virtual machines in the same way.
