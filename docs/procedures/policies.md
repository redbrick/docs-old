# REDBRICK SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR POLICIES

![devotion to duty](/img/devotion_to_duty.png)

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to brief new Redbrick system administrators on
the current setup, policies and practices in place and to serve as the place
to record all such information for current and future administrators.

## Admin Account Priviliges

By default, all admin accounts will be placed in the root group for su access
and the log group for read access to system logs. Accounts should not be
placed into any other 'system' or priviliged accounts (e.g. pgsql, mail, news,
etc.) but by all accounts (hah, bad pun!) can be placed into useful groups
(e.g. cvs, webgroup, helpdesk etc.)

## Root account

When su'ing to root, please observe the following:

* Wait for the password prompt before typing in the password! Sometimes lag/terminal freezes or
  whatever can kick in. The other classic mistake is typing the password in place of the username
  (say for a console login).
* Make sure LOGNAME is set to your unix name. The linux/solaris boxes will prompt you for this
  (on solaris use 'su -', on linux don't ever use 'su -'). On OpenBSD you can use 'su -m' to keep
  the environment.
* Don't change the root account/finger information!
* If you wish to use another shell, place customisations in your own file. For bash,
  `/root/.bash_profile.<USERNAME>` and for zsh `/root/.zshrc.<USERNAME>`. As for tcsh, no one uses
  that! :-)

`/root/.zshrc` and `/root/.bash_profile` source in the appropriate file as long as `$LOGNAME` is set
right (see above). Do not put personal customisations into the default root account setup, remember
other people have to use it.

Common aliases can be put in /root/.profile, familiarise yourself with the existing ones, they can
come in handy.

* Please keep `/root` tidy. In fact, important admin stuff should be done/kept in `/srv/admin`,
  that's what it's there for. Don't leave stuff strewn about the place! Make sure to check
  permissions and ownership on files you work on **constantly** especially files with important or
  sensitive information in them (e.g. always use `cp -p` when copying stuff about).
* Only use root account when absolutely necessary. Many admin tasks can be done or tested first
  as a regular user.

## Gotchas

Couple of things to look out for:

* `killall` command, never ever use it!
* Solaris commands which share same name as Linux/BSD commands can often be radically different.
  Always check manpages.
* Alias `cp`, `mv` & `rm` with the `-i` option.
* If you're ever unsure, don't! Ask another admin or check the docs.
* Always always double check commands before firing them off!
* When using `chown` or `chgrp`, always supply `-h` option as by default Solaris chown/chgrp will
  change the ownership of the file a symlink POINTS TO - NOT the symlink itself!

## Admin mailing lists

* All accounts in the root group must be on the admin mailing list and vice versa. Admins who
  leave/join the root group must be added/removed from the list respectively.
* Admins should also join the admin-discuss list. This is the ideal list to discuss admin issues
  where a more open discussion or a wider input is needed. Admin-discuss should be used in
  preference of rb-admins for discussion, unless there is a good reason.
* Elected admins should also be on the elected-admins list. This address is mainly used for mail
  to paypal and stuff.
* There is also a [redbrick-fallout](http://groups.google.ie/group/redbrick-fallout) list on google
  which admins should join, for like when shit happens :)

## Admin Account Responsibilities

As an adminisitrator, your normal user account has extra priviliges (namely being in the root group).
For this reason, you should not run *any* untrusted or unknown programs or scripts. If you must,
and source code is available you should check it before running it. Compile your own versions of
other user's programs you use regularly. It is far too easy for other users to trojan your account
in this manner and get root.

Do not use passwordless ssh keys on any of your accounts. When using an untrusted workstation (i.e.
just about any PC in DCU!) always check for keyloggers running on the local machine and never use
any non system or non personal copies of PuTTY/ssh - there's no way of knowing if they have been
trojaned.

## General Responsibilities

Look after and regularly monitor all systems, network, hardware and user requests (ones that fall
outside of helpdesk's realm, of course!).

Actively ensure system and network security. We can't police all user accounts and activities, but
basic system security is paramount! Keep uptodate with bugtraq/securityfocus etc. Check system logs
regularly, process listings, network connections, disk usage, etc.

RCS is used extensively throughout the system for all configuration files and documentation. The RCS
commands you'll use most are probably co -l (checkout) and ci -u (check in). Don't forget to check
out **before** editing the file.

## Downtime

All downtime must be scheduled and notified to the members well in advance by means of motd &
*announce*. If it's really important, a mail to redbrick-announce may be necessary.

All unexpected/unscheduled downtime (as a result of a crash or as an emergency precaution) must be
explained to the members as soon as possible after the system is brought back. A post to announce,
notice in motd and possibly a mail to committee/admins is sufficient.

When performing a shutdown, start the shutdown 5 or 10 minutes in advance of the scheduled shutdown
time to give people a chance to logout. It may also be useful to disable logins at this stage with a
quick explanation in `/etc/nologin`.

## Documentation

Please read all the documentation before you do anything, but remember that the docs aren't complete
and are sometimes out of date. Please update them as you go :D
