# Project Ideas

The point of this page is to dump ideas which could be cool/useful/interesting,
so not all the stuff here needs to get done. The idea is that someone who has
too much free time, or looking to learn more about the subject can go work on
it. Please leave your name beside your suggestions, so that people can like ask
you about them.

Most of these projects don't require being an admin to work on, in any case, you
can drop a message to whoever suggested the project to talk about it. If you
would like to suggest a project just create a PR on
[Github](https://github.com/redbrick/docs/pulls)

## Small Scripts


## Larger Projects

- Improvement of web boards interface to appeal to newbies (David)
  - If you're doing this, you should hang around boards through one of the old
    fashioned interface for a while first (slrn/tin/thunderbird/whatever. An
    actual client). A lot of the stuff that's different from normal forum
    systems is to do with nntp being fundamentally different from web forums,
    stuff that if you change, you may as well just move to real web forums, and
    leave INN2 running in the background. Also, isn't this primarly a webmaster
    thing? Anyway, just my 2c.- lil_cain
  - [MuffinReader](https://github.com/Chewie/MuffinReader)
