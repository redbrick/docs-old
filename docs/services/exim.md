# Exim on RedBrick

All RedBrick machines run exim for mail sending. With the exception of the mail servers, all the
machines should just forward all their mail to Redbrick's MX records.

The mail servers do the actual delivery to user home directories, receive mail from the internet etc.

## Mail Setup

Please document this properly.

#### Mail Aliases

Aliases need to be set on the primary mailhost.

The aliases are stored in `/etc/mail`.

* aliases - system aliases, stuff like admins, committee
* personal_aliases - aliases for user accounts
* user_disusered_aliases
* user_rename_aliases - put aliases in here when you rename users.
* lists_aliases - aliases that forward mail from mailing lists to the boards.
  Depends on [mail2nntp](/procedures/redbrick-apt)
* virtuals

All these files are under git. Be sure to check them in and out when editing.
After making changes just `make exim_aliases` to rebuild the aliases. This
doesn't require a restart of exim to take affect.

The `exim_aliases.txt` file is generated by the makefile. It should always reflect
the aliases currently live. You should not edit this file by hand, it won't do
anything anyway.

## Other machines

Basic exim setup to just forward all mail...

### I have debian/ubuntu \o/

Lucky you. Despite debian's best efforts to make configuring exim a massive pain
your job is fairly easy. Just `dkpg-reconfigure exim-config` and tell it that
you have a `smarthost` which is `mailhost.redbrick.dcu.ie`

In its infinite wisdom, debian get's the bit of the email address after the `@`
by reading `/etc/mailname`, and chopping off everything before the first dot.
So you should have the server's FQDN in here *not* redbrick.dcu.ie, since
that'll make everyone send mail as dcu.ie.

### I don't have debian :(

* Install Exim from somewhere.
* Go through the config file and fill out primary_hostname & qualify_domain (should be redbrick.dcu.ie)
  along with whatever else takes your fancy.
* Unless you know what you're doing don't touch the acl section.
* Delete the Routers & Transports section
* Put this in it's place:

```

* Don't touch anything else, unless you want to ;)
* If you're scripting this to run as a service the options you probably want
  are: `/path/to/exim -bd -q10m`
