# LDAP

## Current Situation

* Primary LDAP Runs on Morpheus.internal
* Secondary LDAP Runs on Deathray.internal, slaving Morpheus
* Linux User machines (Minerva, Morpheus, Carbon, Murphy) Configured to try
  both Servers

## Useful Methods for manipulating ldap

For more information on these commands see there man pages, but heres a how do
I do something quickly with ldap overview.

### ldapsearch

Dump out the database in ldif form (piping to less can be useful)

``` bash
ldapsearch -D cn=root,ou=ldap,o=redbrick -y /etc/ldap.secret -xLLL
```

Search for something in particular (In this case all users updated by johan)

``` bash
ldapsearch -D cn=root,ou=ldap,o=redbrick -y /etc/ldap.secret -xLLL "(updatedby=johan)"
```

Here it gets interesting, all members who were updated by johan:

``` bash
ldapsearch -D cn=root,ou=ldap,o=redbrick -y /etc/ldap.secret -xLLL "(&(updatedby=johan)(objectClass=member))"
```

These commands spit out everthing in the database for all the matching entries,
if you are ownly looking for secific data, such as there uid, alternate email
and home directory location you can abend these variables to the search query
to only return this information, ie:

``` bash
ldapsearch -D cn=root,ou=ldap,o=redbrick -y /etc/ldap.secret -xLLL "(updatedby=johan)" altmail homeDirectory
```

(The dn which contains the uid will always be printed anyway :)

### ldapmodify

How to modify something in LDAP, like, oh, say, disusering somebody.

Create a file with something similar to this:

``` ldif
dn: uid=username,ou=accounts,o=redbrick
changetype: modify
replace: loginShell
loginShell: /usr/local/shells/disusered
```

Where: username is who you're editing

* `loginShell` is the attribute
* `/usr/l...` is the value

Then run ldapmodify like this:

``` bash
ldapmodify -x -D cn=root,ou=ldap,o=redbrick -y /etc/ldap.secret -f modifyfile
```

Where `modifyfile` is what you created above.

### ldapadd

Occasionally you'll need to add people or things to ldap manually, such as a
user you recreating from backups, or a reserved system name such as a new
machine.

Put the information you would like to add into a file, or if its short or one
entry you can use stdin, in the case of adding a reserved name the file should
look something like this, replacing both instances of redbrick with the reserved
name you would like to add:

``` bash
$ cat update.reservered
dn: uid=redbrick,ou=reserved,o=redbrick
uid: redbrick
description: DNS entry
objectClass: reserved
objectClass: top
```

Then run the following command:

``` bash
ldapadd -D cn=root,ou=ldap,o=redbrick -y /etc/ldap.secret -x -f update.resevered
```

Done, if you opted to use stdin, leave the -f off the end of the command, paste
the data into your terminal after running the command and finish with a `ctrl-d`

## Installing Servers

### Setting up a LDAP Server - Ubuntu

* Install open-ldap: `apt-get install slapd`
* Go to `/etc/ldap` remove schema folder
* Copy the entire schema folder from current server or backup
* Copy `/etc/ldap/slapd.conf` from current server or backup
* Create directory for database files - currently `/var/lib/ldap`
* `Chown` directory to ldap user/group - currently `openldap`
* Import an ldif using `slapadd -v -l <location of ldif>`
* `Chown` all files in `/var/lib/ldap` to `openldap`
* Edit `/etc/defaults/slapd` to set hostname to `ldap://Server.internal.ip.address:389/`
* Sacrifice lamb - start `slapd`
* Check contents of ldap directory using:

``` bash
ldapsearch -xLLL -D cn=root,ou=ldap,o=redbrick -y /etc/ldap.secret -h Server.internal.ip.address | less
```

### Setting Up a Secondary Server - Replication

For detailed information on all this see [Open LDAP Docs](http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24/replication.html)

* Install openldap as above, assuming a ubuntu server, otherwise hf.
* The following ACLs (Access Control Lists) may need to be modified on the
  *primary* server to allow the replication user read the database, the last
  2 lines are not ACL's, they set up the server to act as a provider, so just as
  important:

ACL's:

``` ldif
access to dn.children="ou=2002,ou=accounts,o=redbrick"
            by dn.regex="cn=root,ou=ldap,o=redbrick" write
            by dn.regex="cn=slurpd,ou=ldap,o=redbrick" read
            by * none

access to dn.children="ou=accounts,o=redbrick" attrs=cn
        by dn.regex="cn=root,ou=ldap,o=redbrick" write
        by dn.regex="cn=slurpd,ou=ldap,o=redbrick" read
            by self read
            by * none

access to attrs=yearsPaid,year,course,id,newbie,altmail
        by dn.regex="cn=root,ou=ldap,o=redbrick" write
        by dn.regex="cn=slurpd,ou=ldap,o=redbrick" read
        by self read
        by * none

access to attrs=userPassword
        by dn.regex="cn=root,ou=ldap,o=redbrick" write continue
        by dn.regex="cn=slurpd,ou=ldap,o=redbrick" read
        by self write
            by anonymous auth
            by * none

access to attrs=gecos,loginShell
        by dn.regex="cn=root,ou=ldap,o=redbrick" write continue
        by dn.regex="cn=slurpd,ou=ldap,o=redbrick" read
            by self write
            by * read

# Default ACL
access to *
         by * read

overlay syncprov
syncprov-checkpoint 100 10
```

* The following needs to be added to the slaves `slapd.conf`, to configure it
  as a slave, this assumes you've copied the primary's config, but removed the
  last 2 lines above and all above references to the slurpd user.

``` text
syncrepl rid=000
        provider=ldap://192.168.0.2:389
        type=refreshAndPersist
        retry="5 5 300 +"
        attrs="*,+"
        binddn="cn=slurpd,ou=ldap,o=redbrick"
        bindmethod=simple
        credentials=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        searchbase="o=redbrick"
```

* You can use this on any secondary server to have it function in a method
  similar to the old slapd - slurpd configuration, for more possible configs see
  the above link, the rid must be a unique identifier for the slave server, so
  increment it if your adding additional slaves.
* Starting the secondary server triggers an update and will transfer all the
  data
* UPDATE USER machines to auth off new ldap

## Re-syncing Secondary LDAP Servers

In the event a secondary server becomes out of sync with the master, it can be
synced by stopping the server, deleting its database files, Currently:
`root@secondaryldapserver#: rm -rf /var/lib/ldap/*`
And then restarting the server, provided its configured as above this triggers
a dump of the current state of the master

## Legacy Situation

If you would like to see some history of ldap on redbrick, including a
discussion between dizer and ryaner, check out this page [ldapsetup](/legacy/procedures/ldapsetup).
