# News

Boards runs on a piece of software called inn2 (InterNetNews). Google turned up
[this document](http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/faqs/inn.html) about it. You
shouldn't really need to touch it anyway.

## Reinstalling news

These steps may require validation

- Install inn2 from apt repos (not inn, which gives you version 1, which is completly different)
- Copy the following : `/etc/news`, `/var/spool/news`, `/var/lib/news` to the
  relevant parts of the new machine.
- Run `makehistory -0`
- cd to `/var/lib/news` and run `makedbz -s $(wc -l < history) -o`
- Reconfigure slrn to use this copy of Inn and check everything's there.
- Change the ip for news.

## Moving news

- Install inn2 (obviously enough)
- Follow the instructions here
  [here](http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/faqs/inn.html#S6.4)
- Note that you do not _need_ anything in `passwd.nntp`, as I was led to
  believe, we seemed to hit upon some sort of weird bug, as long as the old
  server is listed in `incoming.conf`.

## Mailing list boards

Stuff like this is generated by piping into a script from a mail alias

```text
  # Mailing list to news aliases.

Note: The stuff like announce or gamessoc mails going to boards is generated by
mailman

## rss2news

Link looks after this.

## Stopping annoying daily mail

$ head /etc/cron.d/inn2
SHELL=/bin/sh
