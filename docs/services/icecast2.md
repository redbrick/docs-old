# Icecast

Icecast is a streaming server that we currently host on [paphos](/hardware/paphos)

We stream DCUFm's Broadcasts to their apps via a stream presented on
`dcufm.redbrick.dcu.ie:80`

They serve an audio stream (stream128.mp3) via butt on a desktop in their studio
to `icecast2`.

Icecast requires root privilege to bind to Port 80; normally icecast2 runs as
the `icecast2` user and binds to `8001`.

## Procedure

Change
Configure

`/etc/icecast2/icecast.xml`

```xml
<!-- Sources log in with username 'source' --> <-- This is the audio source.
<source-password>$password1</source-password> <-- This must be copied for the DCUFM buttrc.
<!-- Relays log in username 'relay' -->
<relay-password>$password2</relay-password>
<admin-user>admin</admin-user> <-- This is for the WebUI frontend
<admin-password>$password3</admin-password>

<hostname>dcufm.redbrick.dcu.ie</hostname>

<listen-socket>
<port>80</port>
<bind-address>136.206.15.101</bind-address> <-- i.p. addr for dcufm.redbrick.dcu.ie A Record.
```

After that you must configure the default behaviour for the icecast server to allow icecast2 to bind
to port 80.

Set `USERID` & `GROUPID` in `/etc/defaults/icecast2` to `root`
