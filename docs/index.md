# Redbrick System Documentation

The idea of Redbrick documention is to keep an up to date information about the
technical infrastructure of Redbrick. This is mostly intended for admins, future
admins, webmasters, and everybody else who is grumpy and has no life.

The search box actually **works** (I was amazed at this. Search isn't meant to
work. Ever. For anything).

## System Documentation Redundancy

### docs.redbrick.dcu.ie

This is a self hosted version running on halfpint. Its a cron job that pull from
github once an hour and if it finds an update it rebuilds the site.

### Github

Github is where docs are stored. They are plain markdown but they
are easily accessed and read from anywhere.

### ReadTheDocs

Docs are auto deployed to [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.io) on commit to the `master` branch.
They should always be up to date.
