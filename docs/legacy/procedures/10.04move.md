Stuff that needs to get done:

* ~~Get a red dell and set it up for secondary LDAP and DNS~~
* Find a damn 10.04 disk.
* Thunder to 10.04, because mysql is a cunt and won't replicate things with
	different versions.
* Install Deathray with 10.04 and make it run everything that morpheus does.
  (night-time migration of services)
* Install Morpheus with 10.04 and move all the services back.
* Wipe Deathray( all the work for nothing! :( ) and make it just be plain old
  deathray, but with 10.04 (shiny)
* Install Harrison (this is my name for the box until reggie comes up with one)
  with 10.04 - zomgz new login box
