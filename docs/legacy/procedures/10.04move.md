Stuff that needs to get done:


*  <del>Get a red dell and set it up for secondary LDAP and DNS</del>



*  Find a damn 10.04 disk.


*  Thunder to 10.04, because mysql is a cunt and won't replicate things with different versions.


*  Install Deathray with 10.04 and make it run everything that morpheus does. (night-time migration of services)
 

*  Install Morpheus with 10.04 and move all the services back.


*  Wipe Deathray( all the work for nothing! :( ) and make it just be plain old deathray, but with 10.04 (shiny)


*  Install Harrison (this is my name for the box until reggie comes up with one) with 10.04 - zomgz new login box
