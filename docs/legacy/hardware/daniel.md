### Creating a VM
Daniel `/xen` partition holds scripts disk images and iso's for the VMs

To create a VM use `/xen/scripts/vmcreate.sh`

This Script takes information provided to it by you and uses this information to
create a Xen config for a VM as well as a Disk Image. In order to keep things
simple all VMs will be created as full hvm machines with an ISO attached for the
OS required.

Symlinks in `/xen/isos` need to point to the current ISO for a Distro, subsets
of distros, such as hardy or intrepid can be handled, this is currently only set
up for Debian and Ubuntu, needs to be completed for all OSs

The IP for a VM is set by reading the first IP from the `/xen/scripts/freeips`,
this file can be updated using `/xen/scripts/testfreeips.sh` - this script needs
to be modified to check against Xen Configs as well as using ping.

In order for the User to be able to install there VM they will need to use a
VNCViewer to access the console of there VM, this can be acomplised with port
forwarding, it would be nice if we could find some nice java app or something
that we could run on a Service VM to allow users access the console easier

The vmcreate script uses `/xen/scripts/createdisk.sh` to create a disk for the
vm in `/xen/disk`

The config is moved to `/etc/xen/configs` after creation and symlinked to
`/etc/xen/auto` which will cause the VM start with Xen in the event of a reboot

At the end is a list of Things that need to be done manually

These include:

* Adding the VM to DNS in the form hostname.vm.redbrick.dcu.ie
* Adding rules to cynic's `/etc/pf.conf` that only allow access from the VM to
  its VNC port

### Left to do on Daniel

* Script to Delete / Disable VMs
* ISOs /Symlinks for major OS's
* Web Based VNC System? - if unsecure this should run on VM
* `vmcreate.sh` needs to email user and more robust error checking would be nice too.
