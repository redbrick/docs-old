## Sprout

Sprout runs OpenBSD. We like OpenBSD. Sprout is the new fap, welmar & obelisk all rolled into a nice dell case.

Other things you should know about sprout:

*  It's a dual Xeon poweredge 1600 with 1gb of ram.

*  We bought it for â‚¬200 on adverts.ie

*  It's scsi controller seems botched, it uses two ide disks that used to be in fap.

*  It has two CD drives, one works, and the other is to fill up the blank space.

*  The floppy drive would work, but johan disconnected the cable.

*  The network cards came from asplodey (the only good part of aspolodey). Of course this meant some "custimzation" was required to make them actually fit.

## Things which sprout does

### Syslog-ng

Sprout is the loghost. /var/log is an entire 200gb ide disk. It is expected that this will be full in about 2020, long after I'm gone.
