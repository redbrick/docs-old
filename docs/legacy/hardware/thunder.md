## Mysql

Thunder is a mysql replication slave. The replication user is called replication, the password for this is in pwsafe. The [mysql docs](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replication-howto.html) on how to set this up are fairly good. The procedure for resyncing this with the master is documented on the [mysql](/services/mysql) page.

## Known Issues


*  The onboards SATA ports appear not to work

*  It doesn't like talking to USB keyboards.

*  <del>One of the older disks (disk 2), may be dodgy.</del> They were both dodgy. They died. I cried.
