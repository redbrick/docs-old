# Webchat qircd

Werdz has created a redbrick version of qwebirc. This can be cloned from [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/werdz/redbrick-qwebirc)

## Install Proccess

### Dependencies

The following packages need to be installed

- python
- python-twisted
- sun-java6-jdk or sun-java6-jdr (some java interpreter)  

### Qwebirc user

Qwebirc runs with its own system user and group called qwebirc with home directory
`/opt/redbrick-qwebirc` which will need to be created.

### Clone HG Rep

Clone the redbrick version of qwebirc from redbrick's mercurial repository to it's home directory
`/opt/redbrick-qwebirc`

``` bash
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/werdz/redbrick-qwebirc
```

It needs to be compiled once it has been cloned. There is a compile script in the root of
redbrick-qwebirc

``` bash
python compile.py
```

### Config file

There is a config.py.example file in the root directory, it's well documented and prefilled for
redbrick setup.
When you're happy copy/rename to config.py.

### Upstart Script

Qwebirc doesn't like being started from outside its directory, presumably it uses relative paths to
load stuff,
so the chdir directive is important to make the upstart script work.

Upstart script /etc/init/webchat.conf

``` text
