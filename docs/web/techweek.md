# TechWeek Website

The repository containing the Techweek website is in Github [redbrick/techweek](https://github.com/redbrick/TechWeek)
repository.
The website was written to have the Google Material Design look and feel. MaterializeCSS was used
to speed up the process.

## Deployment

To deploy to a server just run from the parent of of the folder you want to deploy too.
_example writen assuming folder deployed is techweek/dist_

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/redbrick/techweek.git
cd techweek
npm install
```

Currently techweek is stored in `/webtree/t/techwk` and apache is set to serve from the `dist`
folder.
DNS for techweek needs to be in ours own DNS records to point to vhost and in DCU external DNS to
point to us.

## How it works

The markdown files in the `pages` dir contains a JSON blob containing all events details.
This blob says what template to use.
Each page is a markdown file with a json blob at the beginning with all the details about that years
talks.
The Json is used to fill a mustache template since all the pages are the same format and layout and
output to dist.

The `main.js` file is responsible for displaying the countdown and loading the video feed. Also, it
changes colour of the header and individual days,
depending on the amount of times you have visited the page. It also handles the #Day so a specific
day can be linked to.
Gulp concats this with materilize and minifies it to `dist/js`
