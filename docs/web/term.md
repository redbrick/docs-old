# Web terminal

Redbrick runs multiple web terminal.

- [anyterm](#anyterm)
- [ajaxterm](#ajaxterm)
- [wetty](#wetty)

## Anyterm

`Anyterm` is a fucking heap of shite.

Running at [anyterm.redbrick.dcu.ie](https://anyterm.redbrick.dcu.ie)

### Dependencies

Install `libboost-dev` and `zlib1g-dev` from `apt`

### Building

The latest `anyterm` is 1.1.29 which is built from source and lives in
`/opt/anyterm`. To compile it needs a patch to [SmtpClient.cc](https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo-portage-rsync-mirror/blob/master/www-apache/anyterm/files/anyterm-1.1.29-gcc-4.4.patch),
then

``` bash
make
make install
```

There's an init script `/etc/init.d/anyterm` that runs anyterm on
`localhost:7777`. The command `anyterm` runs is a python script that SSHes to
`login.redbrick`.

### Anyterm Apache config

There's an apache vhost for anyterm on metharme to do https and proxy into the
anyterm.

## Ajaxterm

I like this lots more, cause it's installed from apt.

Running at [ajaxterm.redbrick.dcu.ie](https://ajaxterm.redbrick.dcu.ie)

### Ajaxterm Apache config

  RewriteRule .*$  https://ajaxterm.redbrick.dcu.ie$1 [NC,R,L]
</VirtualHost>
```

### Init Config

Modify the init script. Change:

``` bash
start-stop-daemon --start --group=$AJAXTERM_GID --pidfile $PIDFILE --exec $DAEMON -- --daemon --port=$PORT --serverport=$SERVERPORT \
                                --uid=$AJAXTERM_UID >/dev/null
```

to:

```bash
start-stop-daemon --start --group=$AJAXTERM_GID --pidfile $PIDFILE --exec $DAEMON -- --daemon --port=$PORT --serverport=$SERVERPORT \
                                --uid=$AJAXTERM_UID --command=/usr/local/bin/anyterm.py >/dev/null
```

### Anyterm.py

Is a hack python script.

``` python
#!/usr/bin/python

something = raw_input( "Username: " )

import os, re

while ( re.search(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9_.-]', something ) ):
        print "Sorry, but you have invalid characters in your username. Please try again!"
        something = raw_input( "Username: " )
else:
        os.system( 'ssh %s@login.redbrick.dcu.ie' % something )
```

## Wetty

I like this best because it actually looks good and runs from a container.

Running at [redbrick.dcu.ie/wetty](https://redbrick.dcu.ie/wetty)

### Source

When installing butlerx got sick of the lack of development on the project and
decided to fork it and pull in changes from contributors such as mobile support
and reconnect button. As well as make it better for running from a container and
better ssh support.

His fork is on [github](https://github.com/butlerx/wetty)

### Setup

Specify the host to ssh to and the port to run on in the docker-compose file then just run

``` bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Then just use apache to proxy to the port.
